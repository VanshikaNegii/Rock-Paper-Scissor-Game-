# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-
College Project (year 2022) using C language only

Appropriate usage of C language’s control statements, functions and basic core concepts has made this game a success. Beginner friendly, and a combination of both high level, low level language allows one to make simplest to complex projects by knowing the crux of it.


Globally declaring ‘user’ and ‘Computer’ variables made them accessible from anywhere in the program. 
Choice of player one i.e. HUMAN is accepted through menu function defined before main function, and to get Computer’s choice, setup function is defined. Rand function is used because a number generated by it, when divided(Modulus Operator) by 4, will give the remainder from 1-3. Three choices are only required in this game.
Creating all possible combinations –
(Rock,Rock), (Rock,Paper), (Rock,Scissor)
(Paper,Rock), (Paper,Paper), (Paper,Scissor)
(Scissor,Rock), (Scissor,Paper), (Scissor,Scissor)


-We use switchcase statement with conditional if, ifelse statements for declaration of win, lose and draw.
In main function, all defined functions are called to run with an infinite loop. Also to get fresh console after each round, cls function is used. Also, to hold console until next click, getch() function has been used at end.
